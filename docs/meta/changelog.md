## 0.8.*

### 0.8.0 - 2025-09-19 - Realtime frequency filters for `stream` and test adjustments

#### New Features
- [`#121`](https://github.com/Aharoni-Lab/mio/pull/121) - Adds optional realtime frequency filtering to `mio stream`. Example usage:  
  ```bash
  mio stream capture -c wireless-200px -f remove_stripe_example
  ```  
  See the CLI docs for more details.

#### Bugfixes
- [`#121`](https://github.com/Aharoni-Lab/mio/pull/121) - The FFT/IFFT operation on videos sometimes produced values larger than the maximum of the type (e.g., 255 for `np.uint8`), resulting in bright artifacts. The frequency mask helper method now clips values before returning them to prevent this.

#### Refactors
- [`#121`](https://github.com/Aharoni-Lab/mio/pull/121) - `FrequencyMaskingConfig` is now a subclass of `MiniscopeConfig, ConfigYAMLMixin`, allowing it to be treated like other configs.

#### Testing
- [`#132`](https://github.com/Aharoni-Lab/mio/pull/132), [`#134`](https://github.com/Aharoni-Lab/mio/pull/134) - Pin macOS version to `macos-14` due to upstream issues in the Coveralls action.
- [`#121`](https://github.com/Aharoni-Lab/mio/pull/121) - Add basic tests to ensure the method is invoked via CLI.


## 0.7.*

### 0.7.1 - 2025-08-07

#### Bugfix

- [`#125`](https://github.com/Aharoni-Lab/mio/pull/125) - If a device configuration caused the
  `buffer_npix` method to not match the number of buffers per frame returned by the device,
  frame headers would be duplicated when sent through the rest of the pipeline,
  resulting in duplicate rows in the resulting csv file.
  Behavior was fixed, and the warning was upgrade to a more explicit exception message
  that is more informative about the nature of the problem

#### Added

- [`#125`](https://github.com/Aharoni-Lab/mio/pull/125) - the `BufferedCSVWriter` class now
  takes an explicit list of values to use as the headers, and accepts dicts for rows that
  match those headers. this makes for explicit alignment in produced tables,
  ignoring extra values and filling missing values.
- [`#117`](https://github.com/Aharoni-Lab/mio/pull/117) - A {class}`mio.plots.VideoPlotter`
  class was added to display a list of videos together

#### Refactor

- [`#116`](https://github.com/Aharoni-Lab/mio/pull/116) - Continuing the process of
  splitting up the {class}`mio.stream_daq.StreamDaq` class, the method for
  iterating over an arbitrary-sized input buffer from a device, concatenating it,
  and splitting it into buffers according to some `preamble` bytestring
  was split into a {func}`mio.stream_daq.iter_buffers` generator function,
  where the binary source of devices is now any iterator that yields bytestrings.
  Corresponding `__iter__` methods were added to {class}`mio.devices.opalkelly.okDev`.

#### Testing

- [`#125`](https://github.com/Aharoni-Lab/mio/pull/125) - Added a performance test with a generous
  baseline to ensure that the streamdaq runs without significant delays.

### 0.7.0 - 2025-07-21 - Processing Module & Video Encoding Fixes
PRs: [`#83`](https://github.com/Aharoni-Lab/mio/pull/83), [`#94`](https://github.com/Aharoni-Lab/mio/pull/94), [`#97`](https://github.com/Aharoni-Lab/mio/pull/97), [`#99`](https://github.com/Aharoni-Lab/mio/pull/99), [`#112`](https://github.com/Aharoni-Lab/mio/pull/112)
#### Changes
- **Added video processing (denoising) module for neural recordings.** This module is currently for offline use with video files. Real-time integration with `streamDaq` is planned for a future update.
    - Includes features like **broken frame detection** and **horizontal stripe removal**.
    - Refer to `Preprocessing videos` in the documentation for more details.
- **Resolved video encoding bug in export.** Exported videos are now **deterministic**, as intended for the current uncompressed setup.
    - The `VideoWriter` class was also **isolated from the `streamDaq` module** for broader usability.



## 0.6 - Becoming `mio`

### 0.6.0 - 24-12-10

#### Breaking Changes

- `miniscope-io` is now known as `mio`! Big thanks to [`@heuer`](https://github.com/Aharoni-Lab/mio/issues/77)
  for graciously giving us the name. This gives us a nice, short name that is uniform
  across pypi, the repository, and the cli.
- The {meth}`mio.models.config.LogConfig.level_file` and {meth}`mio.models.config.LogConfig.level_stdout`
  fields are no longer automatically populated from the `level` field. 
  This was because of the way the multi-source config system propagates values between
  sources with different priorities. Now downstream consumers should check if these values
  are `None` and use the `level` field if so. 

#### Config

Two big changes to config:

- [`#72`](https://github.com/Aharoni-Lab/mio/pull/72) - `@sneakers-the-rat` - Global config, user config
  from multiple sources: see the [config](../guide/config.md) documentation for more
- [`#76`](https://github.com/Aharoni-Lab/mio/pull/76) - `@sneakers-the-rat` - Convert `formats` to `yaml`.
  We finally got rid of the godforsaken self-inflicted wound of having instantiated models
  serve as config, and instead are using `yaml` everywhere for static config. This includes
  every yaml-able config having a header that indicates which model the config corresponds to,
  a (locally) unique id, which can be used anywhere a path can be, and a version stamp in anticipation
  of being able to handle model migrations.

#### CI

- [`#75`](https://github.com/Aharoni-Lab/mio/pull/75) - `@sneakers-the-rat` - Test docs builds on PRs
  to avoid broken links and references

## 0.5

### 0.5.0 - 24-11-11
Enhancements and bugfixes to `StreamDaq`; adding `device_update` module; CI/CD updates.

#### Features / bugfixes
- **Over-the-air device config:** modules and commands for updating and rebooting; *e.g.,* `mio update --key LED --value 10`, `mio device --reboot`.
- **Continuous run:** updated error handling to continuously capture even when the data stream is interrupted.
- **UNIX timestamp:** added UNIX timestamp to metadata file export.
- **More Opal Kelly bitfiles:** added FPGA configuration images and organized them based on Manchester encoding conventions, frequency, etc.
#### CI/CD
- Switched to `pdm` from `poetry`; now `pdm install --with all` for contributing.
- Added workflow for readthedocs preview link in PRs.
- Added snake_case enforcement (Lint).

## 0.4

### 0.4.1 - 24-09-01

#### Added Features
- Support dummy words at the beginning of buffer to make data detection in `StreamDaq` more robust. The length of this word can be set via the device config YAML file.
- `models.stream.ADCScaling` class for converting ADC raw values into voltage. The scaling factors can be set via the device config YAML file.

**Features:**
- **Metadata handling**: CSV export and real-time plotting of metadata. The plotting feature is experimental and is still very unstable. Also improved metadata error handling.
- **CLI enhancement**: Generate video and metadata csv files with same stem names.

**Models/Formats:**
- **Runtime config**: `StreamDevRuntime` now configures queue and buffer sizes used in `StreamDaq`.

**CI / Bugfix:**
- **Fix termination**: Now buffer size doesn't affect output video. Very good for tests.
- **Device docs section**: For adding documentation about specific devices.
- **CLI docs on RTD**: Mock binaries so CLI docs show up on RTD.
- **Dependency**: Update some packages for Windows compatibility.

## 0.3

### 0.3.0 - 24-07-04

Enhancements to `StreamDaq` and improved CI processes.

Contributors: [@sneakers-the-rat](https://github.com/sneakers-the-rat),  [@t-sasatani](https://github.com/t-sasatani).
Related PRs and Issues: [#29](https://github.com/Aharoni-Lab/miniscope-io/pull/29), [#31](https://github.com/Aharoni-Lab/miniscope-io/pull/31), [#27](https://github.com/Aharoni-Lab/miniscope-io/issues/27)

**Features:**
- **Performance enhancements**: Refactoring of streamDaq to eliminate delays in the default configuration.
- **New CLI**: Introduced a `click`-based CLI offering greater flexibility and scalability.
- **Test coverage**: Integrated Coveralls to display test coverage statistics.
- **BufferFormatter class**: Added for flexible bit/byte operations and decoding incoming buffers.

**Models/Formats:**
- **Configuration changes**: Isolated device config and user config. device config is now stored in `StreamDevConfig` (renamed from `StreamDaqConfig`). User configs are segregated to the CLI.

**CI:**
- **Python 3.12 compatibility**: Added tests for Python 3.12.
- **StreamDaq tests**: Fixed issues with video hash assert tests in `streamDaq`.
- **Global test timeout**: added global timeout for all tests.
