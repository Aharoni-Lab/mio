"""
from https://miniscope-io.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/models/buffer.html#mio.models.buffer.BufferHeader.frame_buffer_count

linked_list (int) – Index of data buffers within the circulating structure. 
This increments with each buffer until it reaches [num_buffers](../api/stream_daq.md), then resets to zero.

frame_num (int) – The index of the image frame, which increments with each image frame (comprising multiple data buffers).

buffer_count (int) – Index of data buffers, which increments with each buffer.

frame_buffer_count (int) – Index of the data buffer within the image frame. 
It is set to frame_buffer_count = 0 at the first buffer in each frame.

write_buffer_count (int) – Number of data buffers transmitted out of the MCU.

dropped_buffer_count (int) – Number of dropped data buffers.

timestamp (int) – Timestamp in milliseconds. 
This should increase approximately by 1 / framerate * 1000 every frame.
